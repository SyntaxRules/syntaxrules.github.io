title:  "Creating IoT Devices"
tags: IoT getting-started software
---

Some years ago I was tasked to create a number of IoT devices from scratch. The goal of this was to create low-cost sensors for factory automation. When I started my knowledge of circuit design, pcb design and the manufacturing process was non-existant. My background is in software, I was use to blaming hardware engineers- not creating hardware.

This article explains what I did by teaching you (the reader) about IoT today. I'll cover:

  1. The bussiness of IoT (Market, Players, Technologies)
  2. The technologies of IoT (Hardware, Tranportation, Analysis)
  3. Buy or build?
    * Cost Analysis
  4. Building
    * Selecting the Chips
    * Prototypes
    * Manufacture
    * Case
  5. Lessons to Learn
