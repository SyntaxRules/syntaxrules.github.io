Great summary of the need for redfish and an overview of it advantages, specificly for scripting.

DMTF - Distributed Management Task Force, created redfish as a replacement to IPMI. IPMI spec references DMTF and uses their RCMP protocol. DMTF no longer talks about the RMCP protocol.



Make a ipmi to redfish translator so those using a mixed variety can upgrade.

How about making a mock redfish implementation. That way developers can test scripts on it!
