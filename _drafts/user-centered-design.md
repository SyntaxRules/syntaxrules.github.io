# User Centered design

**TLDR**: You should be thinking about users' interactions with the software. Their interface is the most important one and comes first.

Software teams can often get stuck on the question *how do we build it?* before determining the users interactions.

## Who are the users?

The term users, is a generic one. It means different things for different projects. For a web application, this refers to the actual humans that are using your webpage. For a python library, users are the developers that will be looking and trying to userstand the public API.

In all cases the part that the users see's will make or break your project. That experience will determine weather new users become users and if you can retain users.

## User centered desgin

Every now and then someone comes up with a new "X centered design" paradigm and they argue that we should all be doing it. I've heard data centered design, design for testability, and a few others. 

User centered design is making your users needs and interfaces come first. For a webpage that means possible wireframes and prototypes. For an API, that means determining the functions and signatures you want your users to be using, and documenting them. (WHAT?! documentation before code?!?)

This same priciple is true when deciding on what your project needs next. Does the users' interface work well? What could be improved? Often times developers and managers ask less then ideal question like: What does this program need next? or How can it be improved? While I'm all for a planned architecture and refactor tasks, these activities should be a result of wanting to improve the users' interface.
