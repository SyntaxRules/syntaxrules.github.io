# A sucessfuly open source project

When a company decides to make a project open source, it often only goes through one step, copying the code to github. But this does not make the project a sucess. In fact projects like this are often quickly overlooked. This begs the question: What do people look for when selecting an open source project to use?

10 Things to do, to get your open source project looked at:
1. Have a README.md
2. Have releases on the project page. This is one of the first places I look. It tells me if the project has regular releases and speaks to how well the project is maintained.
3. Issues and pull requests. If you have these and I'm thinking about using your library, I'll probably look at them. If they are long lasting bugs, thats bad, if they are well structured ehancements, thats good.
4. CI badges in your readme.md. This is a tall tale sign that the project has its act together and won't be shipping a broken build anytime soon.
5. Be compatible with package managers. Having a good description and readme will help you get your product into the search results for google, but having it in a package manager will get it there twice!
